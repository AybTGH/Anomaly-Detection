# Anomaly Detection in Time Series

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of various algorithms for detecting anomalies in time series data. Anomalies, or outliers, are data points that significantly deviate from the expected pattern, and detecting them is crucial in fields like finance, healthcare, IoT, and more.

## Objectives
- Implement and compare multiple anomaly detection algorithms on diverse time series datasets.
- Evaluate the performance of each algorithm based on metrics like precision, recall, and execution time.
- Provide insights and recommendations on the best practices for anomaly detection in different time series scenarios.

## Algorithms Covered
- **Statistical Methods**: e.g., Z-Score, Moving Average
- **Machine Learning Models**: e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM
- **Deep Learning Models**: e.g., LSTM Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining statistical and ML techniques

## Datasets
The repository includes synthetic and real-world time series datasets, spanning various domains such as finance, sensor data, and more.

## Getting Started
